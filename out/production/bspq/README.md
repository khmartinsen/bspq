The following tools are used to create and view relative coordinates on cosets in a given BS(p,q).

## Data and File Structure Standards
A coset data file contains relative coordinate integers separated by a new line character.\
The file is named by its path in the tree of BS(p,q). The file is placed in a folder named BSP_Q.\

Ex: The coset associated with BTBTbbt in BS(2,4) has the directory path "BS2_4/BTBTbbt".

## Brick Laying

#### Algorithm Overview:

## BS Cayley Viewer
This program is used to view the coset data files in a Cayley graph style.

## Compiling Instructions

#### Manually
add minimal instructions such as java --module-add
